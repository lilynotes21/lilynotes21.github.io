## Coding with R and Python ##

One thing that is cool about R is that you can easily transfer codes/objects from R to Python and vice versa. Below is an example of how you can do this.

First, load the 'reticulate' package in R and define your object (which could be anything really). In this case, I will be defining "This is my" as the object "dog".
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

dog<-"This is my"
```

Now, define "dog" (or the assigned name you used above) as an object in Python. Here, I define "dog" as "dog, Cooper". Then, use print() and use the code "r.(your R-defined object), (Python-defined object, should be the same as the R-defined object)". The "r.(your R-defined object)" will allow you to access, select, and share defined objects from your R environment so that you can use them in Python! 
```{python}
#Python code chunk
dog="dog, Cooper."
print(r.dog,dog) #access R-defined objects with r. 
```
As you can see, the output prints a combination of information from "dog" from R first and Python second. Pretty cool! 

Below is an example of how you can also combine information from Python to R. All you need to do is reference desired information from Python in R. Here, I reference "dog" which is the defined object I used in the previous codes above. Then, I use py$dog to select that object from Python.
```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(dog,py$dog)) #access Python-defined objects with py$
```
Like before, the result is a combination of information, but this time from Python first, then R.

Now you have a basic understanding of how to use R and Python interchangeably. 

However, you may be wondering, what does my dog Cooper look like? Well, I'm glad you asked! 

Here's a picture of my dog, Cooper! He is about to be 4 years old this summer, he loves playing fetch and he can jump about 5 feet high! He is also a big UT fan!
